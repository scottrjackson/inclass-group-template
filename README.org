* MEM Workshop Group Session

This is a (mostly) empty repo to be used as a simple template for
working as a group in sessions of the LSC MEM course/workshop.  Some
guidelines/suggestions:

  - Pull this repo at the beginning of a session to use as your
    personal notes.
  - Create new files/folders to represent your notes, to avoid any
    pull/push merge conflicts.
  - Copy files over from other repos (like the "individual assignment"
    files for the week) as needed or as convenient.
  - *When you have something to share*:
    1. Commit the local changes you want to share
    2. Double-check that you don't have any uncommitted changes on
       files that other people have changed
    3. Pull changes
    4. Push your changes to be shared with the group

Happy modeling!
